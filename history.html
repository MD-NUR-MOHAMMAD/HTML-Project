        <p>Four months after the San Francisco Conference ended, the United Nations officially began, on 24 October 1945, when it came into existence after its Charter had been ratified by China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States and by a majority of other signatories.

            Now, more than 75 years later, the United Nations is still working to maintain international peace and security, give humanitarian assistance to those in need, protect human rights, and uphold international law.
            
            At the same time, the United Nations is doing new work not envisioned for it in 1945 by its founders. The United Nations has set sustainable development goals for 2030, in order to achieve a better and more sustainable future for us all. UN Member States have also agreed to climate action to limit global warming.
            
            With many achievements now in its past, the United Nations is looking to the future, to new achievements.

            <p>Forty-six nations, including the four sponsors, were originally invited to the San Francisco Conference. These were the nations which had declared war on Germany and Japan and had subscribed to the United Nations Declaration. One of these nations - Poland - did not send a representative because the composition of its new government was not announced until too late for the conference. Therefore, a space was left for the signature of Poland, one of the original signatories of the United Nations Declaration. At the time of the conference there was no generally recognized Polish Government, but on 28 June such a government was announced and on 15 October 1945, Poland signed the Charter, thus becoming one of the original 51 Members. The conference itself invited four other states - the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, newly-liberated Denmark and Argentina. Thus delegates of fifty nations in all, gathered at the San Francisco Conference in April 1945.

These were the nations which had declared war on Germany and Japan and had subscribed to the United Nations Declaration. One of these nations - Poland - did not send a representative because the composition of its new government was not announced until too late for the conference. Therefore, a space was left for the signature of Poland, one of the original signatories of the United Nations Declaration. At the time of the conference there was no generally recognized Polish Government, but on 28 June such a government was announced and on 15 October 1945, Poland signed the Charter, thus becoming one of the original 51 Members. The conference itself invited four other states - the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, newly-liberated Denmark and Argentina. Thus delegates of fifty nations in all, gathered at the San Francisco Conference in April 1945.

              Forty-six nations, including the four sponsors, were originally invited to the San Francisco Conference.
